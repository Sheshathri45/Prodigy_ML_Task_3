🎯 Completed: Machine Learning Internship Task 03
 🐾 Topic: Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM
 🏢 Internship: Prodigy InfoTech
 🤖 Task: Build an image classifier to distinguish between cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶 using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

🔍 This task helped me to:

💠 Understand how SVM separates classes with the best decision boundary (hyperplane).

💠 Apply image preprocessing + feature extraction for classification.

💠 Realize that classical ML (HOG + SVM) can achieve strong accuracy with low computation.

💠 Learn the importance of hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma, kernel).
